# AWX Promotion Pipeline

Ansible AWX code promotion solution using Ansible playbooks and the tower modules. This can be consumed via Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab and others for full code promotion and rigid tower resource definitions. This solution also allows you to audit your code promotion using native Git tools.

This tool was written completly wrapping over the Tower Modules for Ansible. See: [Parameters](#supported-parameters)

## Requirements

### Python Packages

- ansible-tower-cli

To install these python pacakges run the following command.

```bash
pip install ansible-tower-cli
```

If using Ansible AWX

```bash
/var/lib/awx/venv/awx/bin/pip install ansible-tower-cli
```

If using Jenkins/Docker Images, you will need to install these packages or bake them into your image.

## Getting Started

In order to use this pipeline we need to define a base set of variables in the `vars/` sub-directory.

We've provided a base example called `vars/NA_development.yml`.

Either modify this to your liking, or create a new one for use. All variables defined are required.

### Generate Base .awx-pipeline.yml

If you want to generate the absolute minimum working project/job_template definitions in an .awx-pipeline.yml, use the `generate-pipeline.yml` provided playbook.

```bash
ansible-playbook generate-pipeline.yml
```

```bash
Project Name: Test
Project Description: Test Description
Project Organization Name [default]: admin-oar
Project SCM URL: https://github.com/anthonyloukinas/ping.git
Job Template Name: Testing
Job Template Playbook YML: main.yml
```

That will output the following to your directory: `awx-pipeline-Test.yml`

*Note: Your file name may be different depending on what your Project was named. It's also recommended to use _'s and no spaces.*

```yaml
---

job_templates:
  Testing:
    name: Testing
    project: Test
    playbook: main.yml
    job_type: run
    ask_inventory: yes # Set to no, if inventory: "" var set

project:
  name: Test
  description: Test Description
  organization: admin-oar
  # scm_credential: ""
  scm_url: https://github.com/anthonyloukinas/ping.git
```

You can add additional configuration to this file, and then place it in your code repository base, named `.awx-pipeline.yml`. See [Supported Paramters](#supported-parameters). 

There is also an example pipeline file included in the repository with many options defined [.awx-pipeline-example.yml](.awx-pipeline-example.yml)

## Using the pipeline

### Consume Pipeline using Ansible-Playbook (CLI)

You will need to provide the following variables

- `git_scm_url` (required) - Git repository where Ansible code + .awx-pipeline.yml file exists.
- `git_scm_version` (optional) - Branch/Tag/Commit to specifically use a version of .awx-pipeline.yml
- `project_scm_branch` (optional) - Defines which Branch/Tag/Commit to use for the imported project

These variables are covered in the lane/region specific var files in `vars/`. See: [Getting Started](#getting-started)

- `tower_lane` - Dev, UAT, Prod, etc.
- `tower_region` - NA, EU, ASIA, SA, etc.
- `tower_url` - Base url (http://localhost)
- `tower_username` - Tower username (admin)
- `tower_password` - Tower password (password)

Execute the `run-pipeline.yml` with your vars file `vars/@NA_development.yml`. (See: [Getting Started](#getting-started)), and your `git_scm_url`, which is the code you are wanting to deploy to Ansible Tower.

```bash
ansible-playbook run-pipeline.yml \ 
  -e @vars/NA_development.yml \
  -e git_scm_url=https://github.com/anthonyloukinas/ping.git
```

### Consume Pipeline using Ansible AWX

#### Create Ansible Tower Credential

Start by creating an `Ansible Tower` type credential which will contain your URL, Username, and Password to authenticate to your AWX.

![Create Tower Credential](images/create_tower_cred.png)

#### Create Job Template

- Project: Use this repository, or your own copy.
- Inventory: Use something with localhost. (only preferred)
- Credential: Your Ansible Tower credential.
- Extra Vars: Your tower_lane and tower_region vars.

![Import Job Template](images/import_content_template.png)

#### Create Survey Spec

![Survey Edit](images/survey_edit.png)

#### Launch Job Template

![Survey Prompt](images/survey_prompt.png)

For results see: [Results](#results)

### Consume Pipeline using Jenkins

You will need to setup a job template on your target Ansible Tower to perform the importing. See: [Consume Pipeline using Ansible AWX](#consume-pipeline-using-ansible-awx) and follow all steps.

#### Install Plugins

Home -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Click "Available" tab

Now in the filter search, search for "ansible" and install both plugins

- `Ansible plugin`
- `Ansible Tower Plugin`
- `AnsiColor` - Optional, but recommended for color job outputs in Jenkins.

![Install Ansible Plugin](images/jenkins/install_plugin.png)

Optionally install the `AnsiColor` plugin for color outputs.

![Install AnsiColor](images/jenkins/install_ansicolor.png)

#### Add Ansible Tower Configuration

You need the Ansible Tower plugin installed See: [Install Ansible Plugins](#install-plugins)

Home -> Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Add Ansible Tower

![Ansible Tower Configuration](images/jenkins/configure_ansible_tower_instance.png)
*Note: You will need to create an Ansible Tower credential to authenticate. This user just needs execute access to the import job template*

#### Create Freestyle Build

Home -> New Item -> Freestyle Project

Under `Source Code Management`, Select Git, and fill this out with your Ansible code repository.

![Source Control](images/jenkins/build_source_control.png)

Optionally you can configure polling, which will check into your repo for git commit changes and kick off builds automatically. The supported timing, is cron style.

15 minute polling example:
```
H/15 * * * *
```
*Note: Use this website for creating easy to use cron timings https://crontab.guru/*

![Git Poll](images/jenkins/build_git_poll.png)

Next, add a New Build Step of type `Ansible Tower`.

Fill in your Server and Credentials details. You will also need to find the Template ID from the template you should have created in this step. See: [Consume Pipeline using Ansible AWX](#consume-pipeline-using-ansible-awx). You can get this ID, buy viewing the job template in Tower, and looking at the url.

- Extra Vars:
  - tower_region
  - tower_lane
  - git_scm_url
- Inventory: Use an inventory with localhost
- Credential: Use your [Ansible Tower Credential](#create-ansible-tower-credential)

![Build Step](images/jenkins/build_step.png)

If you installed `AnsiColor` in step [Install Plugins](#install-plugins), Enable it in Build Environment.

![Build environment](images/jenkins/build_env.png)

Save build.

#### Execute build

Browse to new Build Job, and click "Build Now" to initiate a build order.

On the left hand side you will see the new "#1" build begin, click the number to be taken to the build page. If you click "Console Output" you will be taken to the Playbook output from Ansible AWX.

## Appendix

### Removing naming schema (org, lane, region)

If you want to remove the naming schema I've decided on, you can remove this `set_fact` block:

```yaml
## Customizable naming schema
- set_fact:
    tower_naming_schema: "{{ pipeline.project.organization }}_{{ tower_lane }}_{{ tower_region }}_"
```

You may also want to remove the hard coded "Proj" and "Job" strings I've prepended on the resource names as well.

```yaml
- name: Create job template
  tower_job_template:
    name: "{{ tower_naming_schema | default(omit) }}Job_{{ item.key }}" # Remove Job_
```

```yaml
- name: Create project
  tower_project:
    name: "{{ tower_naming_schema | default(omit) }}Proj_{{ pipeline.project.name }}" # Remove Proj_
```

### Supported Parameters

These parameters were directly implemented from the following Ansible Modules:

- tower_project - https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/tower_project_module.html
